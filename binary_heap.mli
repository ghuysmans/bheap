(** Traditional implementation of priority queues using a binary heap
    encoded in a resizable array.

    When documenting complexity below, `n` refers to the number of elements
    in the queue.

    The size of the internal array is doubled when insertion requires
    more space, and halved when less than 25% is used. As a
    consequence, the time spent in enlarging/shrinking the array in a
    sequence of `M` insertions (resp. deletions) is proportional to `M`,
    and thus be considered constant time for each operation. For this
    reason, we do not mention the possibility of a worst case complexity
    `O(n)` in operations add/remove/pop_minimum below. *)
